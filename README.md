When the user presses the .signin button, display the modal window
When the user presses the .close button, hide the modal window
When the user presses the .submit button, add an .error class to both input elements
When the user puts their cursor in one of the input fields, remove the .error class
(Bonus) Allow the user to click the .modal to close itself
Tricky, consider what happens when two elements that are overlapping are both waiting for a click
Things to consider:

How do you select a CSS element by "name" attribute?
Can you create the animation using just CSS? (you don't have to do it, just consider how)
If both input elements have the same functionality, can they share code?
